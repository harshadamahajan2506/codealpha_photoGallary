Responsive Filterable photo Gallery
A modern, high-performance image gallery built with Vanilla JavaScript, CSS Grid, and HTML5. This project features a category-based filtering system and a fully functional lightbox for an immersive viewing experience.

1.Smart Filtering: Instantly sort images by categories: Floral, Nature, and Cinematic.

2.Interactive Lightbox: Click any image to open a full-screen modal with smooth transitions.

3.Intuitive Navigation: Navigate through the gallery using "Next" and "Previous" buttons within the lightbox.

4.Dynamic Source Handling: Automatically detects visible images to ensure navigation only cycles through the active filter.

5.Fully Responsive: Optimized for all screen sizes using CSS Grid repeat(auto-fill, minmax()) logic.

6.Performance Optimized: Uses high-quality CDN links with lazy-loading behavior for fast initial paint.
